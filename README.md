# Petnica-labyrinth-project-2014

I worked on this project at Petnica Science Center during my third year of high school. Also, it was my first Python project.

This repo contains a full file dump of the project, including Python scripts, presentations, posters and the final paper, all in the Serbian language.

You can look at the source code at your own risk, as I stand today completely baffled by the fact that this code worked and produced valid results.

Following is the final paper abstract in English:

<b>Comparing efficiency of algorithms for navigating through the labyrinth</b>
</br></br>
This paper is about comparing several methods of dynamic labyrinth walk-through methods. Namely, we designed two algorithms which assume that the moving agent knows the position of the goal, but does not know the whole configuration of the maze, i.e. the agent learns the configuration as it explores the maze. The first algorithm, based on the combination of a greedy heuristic and the A* algorithm, mimics intuitive, human-like exploring behavior. The second one realizes a random walk oriented toward the goal. The efficiency of previously mentioned algorithms is compared considering the shortest path found by the A* algorithm which was provided by the complete configuration of the maze. A completely stochastic algorithm which realizes a random walk through the maze is also included in the comparative analysis in order to estimate the worst case efficiency. The results of simulations on random generated mazes show that the algorithm which mimics intuitive human-like behavior outperforms probabilistic algorithms giving results closed to the optimal.
